        "* Copy the `SentimentNetwork` class from the previous project into the following cell.\n",
        "* Remove the `update_input_layer` function - you will not need it in this version.\n",
        "* Modify `init_network`:\n",
        ">* You no longer need a separate input layer, so remove any mention of `self.layer_0`\n",
        ">* You will be dealing with the old hidden layer more directly, so create `self.layer_1`, a two-dimensional matrix with shape 1 x hidden_nodes, with all values initialized to zero\n",
        "* Modify `train`:\n",
        ">* Change the name of the input parameter `training_reviews` to `training_reviews_raw`. This will help with the next step.\n",
        ">* At the beginning of the function, you'll want to preprocess your reviews to convert them to a list of indices (from `word2index`) that are actually used in the review. This is equivalent to what you saw in the video when Andrew set specific indices to 1. Your code should create a local `list` variable named `training_reviews` that should contain a `list` for each review in `training_reviews_raw`. Those lists should contain the indices for words found in the review.\n",
        ">* Remove call to `update_input_layer`\n",
        ">* Use `self`'s  `layer_1` instead of a local `layer_1` object.\n",
        ">* In the forward pass, replace the code that updates `layer_1` with new logic that only adds the weights for the indices used in the review.\n",
        ">* When updating `weights_0_1`, only update the individual weights that were used in the forward pass.\n",
        "* Modify `run`:\n",
        ">* Remove call to `update_input_layer` \n",
        ">* Use `self`'s  `layer_1` instead of a local `layer_1` object.\n",
        ">* Much like you did in `train`, you will need to pre-process the `review` so you can work with word indices, then update `layer_1` by adding weights for the indices used in the review."
